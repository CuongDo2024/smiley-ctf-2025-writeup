My smileyCTF 2025 Write-ups! ðŸŽ‰
Hey everyone!

Welcome to my write-ups for the smileyCTF 2025. This was a super fun and challenging CTF hosted by the legendary .;,;. team. As someone who's still learning, I figured I'd document my solutions (or at least my thought process, lol) for the challenges I managed to solve.

It was a great experience, and I learned a ton. Huge shoutout to the organizers and sponsors like OtterSec, Zellic, and Veria Labs!

(Challenge Write-ups)
You can find my solutions for each challenge right here in this repository. I've organized them into folders based on the challenge name. Just navigate to the folder to see the files and my detailed explanation.

I tried my best to explain the steps I took, the tools I used, and how I eventually got the flag. Hopefully, it's helpful to someone else out there!

Categories I attempted:

Cryptography

Reverse Engineering

Web Exploitation

Miscellaneous
