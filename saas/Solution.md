## saas - Smiley-CTF 2025 Write-up

**Challenge:** saas
**Category:** crypto
**Points:** 50

### Introduction

Hey everyone! Just got done with the 'saas' challenge from Smiley-CTF and wanted to write down my thought process. We were given three files to start: a `docker-compose.yaml`, a `Dockerfile`, and the python script, `chall.py`. The name "saas" stands for "squares as a service," which was a pretty big hint. It's a crypto challenge involving what looked like a standard RSA setup, but with a special oracle that would calculate square roots for us. The goal was to somehow use this oracle to break the RSA and sign a message.
