## Project Holoswap - Smiley-CTF 2025 Write-up

**Challenge:** Project Holoswap
**Category:** misc
**Points:** 262

### Introduction
Project Holoswap was a fascinating miscellaneous challenge that revolved around the topic of adversarial machine learning. We were given a Python server script (server.py, a Keras/TensorFlow model model_architecture.json and model.weights.h5), and a starting image gura.png. The goal was to submit a modified image that would be misclassified by the model as a specific target class while remaining perceptually almost identical to the original image.
